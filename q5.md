#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')

This code defines a function called doubleL(n) that takes an integer n as input.
Inside the function, an empty list called res is created.
The code then iterates from 0 to n-1 using a for loop.
Inside the loop, the current value of i is multiplied by 2 and appended to the res list.
After the loop, the function returns the res list.

#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')

This code uses a list comprehension to create a list of numbers from 0 to n-1, doubled.
The list comprehension expression [n * 2 for n in range(n)] iterates from 0 to n-1 and for each value of n, it multiplies it by 2 and adds it to the resulting list.

#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')

This code defines a function called doubleG(n) that takes an integer n as input.
Inside the function, the code iterates from 0 to n-1 using a for loop.
Inside the loop, the current value of i is multiplied by 2 and the result is yielded using the yield keyword.
The yield keyword makes doubleG(n) a generator, which means it can produce a sequence of values on demand.

The function doubleG(n) is a generator.
Generators are a special type of function in Python that can be used to create sequences of values on demand.
This means that the generator does not create the entire sequence of values in memory at once, but instead it generates the values one at a time as needed. This can be useful for large sequences of values, where it would be inefficient to store the entire sequence in memory.
